# Coffee-Shop-Project
A final project to complete the HTML course in the website Patika.dev. Was quite fun and quick project. 

# What I Learned
In this project, I learned the importance of using 'em/rem' instead of just 'px' while adjusting elements and divs inside the css. Also it was good practice to put together everything I've learned in a singular project.
